# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Story Description

This project tells the story of my trip to Dubai. It shows places like Burj Khalifa, Palm Jumeirah, and Dubai Mall, along with how much time I spent at each place and how I rated them. The scenes include:
- Images of each location
- Text with details about each place
- Background colors that change based on the ratings: Green for good ratings, Red for lower ratings.
The data for the project (place names, times, and ratings) is stored in 2D arrays and used to create the animation.

## Image Filter Analysis

The Invert filter changes the colors in the image to the opposite. Dark becomes light and light becomes dark. It makes the image look dramatic. Each pixel’s color is changed by subtracting it from 255 to invert the color.

The Pixelation filter makes the image look blocky by turning small areas into big color blocks. The image is divided into blocks, and the average color of each block is used to color all the pixels in that block.
